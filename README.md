# Vertical scroll of div based on cursor position

This is small script which makes div scrollable and which scroll position depends on cursor current position. It's pretty simple to use it:

You must have container with same id (id="container") and div you want to scroll with id block (id="blocks"). Elements inside "blocks" div you can change for your needs.
